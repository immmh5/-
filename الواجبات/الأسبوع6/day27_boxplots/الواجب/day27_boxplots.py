Tasks:

1-Distribution Shape (Histogram):

    Create a histogram for the score variable.

    Set the number of bins to 20 to reveal the detailed structure of the distribution.

    Ensure the plot includes a title and proper labels for clarity.

2-Categorical Comparison (Boxplot):

    Generate a Boxplot to compare the score distribution across different group categories.

    Identify the median, quartiles (Q1 and Q3), and any potential outliers from the visualization.

3-Interpretation:

    Based on the plots, describe how the distribution of scores differs between groups.

    Explain why a boxplot is more effective than a histogram when comparing multiple categories (groups) side-by-side.
